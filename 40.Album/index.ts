// 40. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object.
// describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
// album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of
// information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
// albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the
// album information correctly.
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
// number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number
// of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new
// function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.

function make_album(artist: string, title: string, tracks?: number) {
    let album = { artist, title, tracks };
    if (tracks) {
        album["tracks"] = tracks;
    }
    return album;
}

console.log(make_album("Artist One", "The First Album"));
console.log(make_album("Artist Two", "The Second Album"));
console.log(make_album("Artist Three", "The Third Album", 12));
