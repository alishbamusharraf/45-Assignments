// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
// should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

/// make array
let names:string[] = ["aqsa","fatima","halima"];

// send message
let message:string = "would you like to learn typescript";
console.log(names[0] + " " + message);
console.log(names[1] + " " + message);
console.log(names[2] + " " + message);
